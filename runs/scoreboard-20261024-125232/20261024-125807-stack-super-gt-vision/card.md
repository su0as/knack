# Skill card: Stack

**Task:** Stack the red cube on top of the blue cube and let go.

- Demonstrations used: **0**
- Reward during practice: `gt`
- Perception and physics: `vision` (poses from OpenCV 5 on rendered RGB-D cameras; wider mass, friction and grip randomisation)
- Practice: 1 rounds, 8 episodes; best version from round 1
- Held-out success (ground truth): **50/50 = 100%** (Wilson 95% CI 93% to 100%)
- Safety layer: 0 halts, 0 clamps over 50 episodes
- OpenCV perception on held-out episodes: 100/100 object sightings (100%), median per-episode position error 0.03 mm
